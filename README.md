# DFA Quiz app

## About
DFA- Quiz app is an educational tool that is aimed to supplement courses that involve finite automata, such as computer science. Currently, the quiz focuses on the conversion of regular expressions to equivalent DFA, but this can be further expanded to more questions. The app allows users to create new quizzes that can be accessed by others to attempt the questions. Each quiz can have as many questions as the user would like. Then users can access the quiz through the home screen using the filter input. Finally, on the quiz screen, the user can draw out the equivalent DSA to the regular expression on the canvas using keyboard and mouse inputs. The app is hosted on a Heroku server. Please allow 15-30 seconds for it to spin up.

## Technologies

 ## What I Learned
 This app gave me an appreciation for the whole development cycle of a full-stack web app, through planning the database and operations for the server to make with the front end. This app allowed for all the CRUD operations except the edit functionality.  The front-end was coded in React and I got to learn about using a global context through a React app and using dependencies such as MaterialUI, React-Router-Dom. Finally, the project was completed over 3 months using the Scrum process, so I got to practise more with this agile approach to development.
